      <h2>Self-Assessment</h2>

      <p>
        Completing the Computer Science program and developing this ePortfolio has allowed me to see measurable growth
        in both my technical ability and my professional identity. When I began the program, my focus was primarily on
        learning programming syntax and completing assignments successfully. Over time, my perspective shifted from
        writing code that works to designing systems that are maintainable, efficient, secure, and aligned with real-world
        constraints. The capstone process, particularly enhancing a single artifact across multiple computer science domains,
        reinforced how interconnected software engineering, algorithms, databases, and security truly are.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the program, I developed a stronger understanding of how collaboration supports better software outcomes.
        Although many assignments were completed individually, the process of participating in code reviews, responding to
        instructor feedback, and refining artifacts for clarity helped simulate professional collaboration. Writing modular,
        readable code with clear comments became increasingly important as I prepared my work for review. In my capstone artifact,
        I structured the application into separate modules for UI logic, business logic, database interaction, and permissions.
        This organization reflects industry best practices and supports collaborative environments where multiple developers can
        work within clearly defined boundaries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Communication has also been a significant area of growth. In addition to technical implementation, I have learned to explain
        design decisions, justify trade-offs, and adapt explanations to different audiences. The code review video required me to present
        technical enhancements in a way that would be understandable to peers or a manager rather than focusing solely on low-level
        implementation details. Writing structured narratives for each enhancement also strengthened my ability to communicate complex
        ideas clearly and professionally. These skills are essential in real-world environments where technical decisions must support
        stakeholder understanding and organizational decision-making.
      </p>

      <p>
        The enhancement of my inventory tracking application demonstrates my competency in data structures and algorithms. I implemented
        a custom merge sort algorithm to manage sorting operations with predictable O(n log n) complexity, rather than relying entirely on
        built-in methods. I also used a Map-based indexing structure to provide constant-time SKU lookups and reinforce uniqueness constraints
        in memory. These improvements required thoughtful consideration of efficiency, scalability, and maintainability. They also reflect my
        ability to evaluate computing solutions and manage trade-offs between simplicity and performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        From a software engineering perspective, I transformed an early C++ console application into a modular web-based application.
        This involved separating responsibilities across UI, service, and database layers, improving usability, and restructuring the codebase
        for maintainability. The addition of IndexedDB introduced persistent storage through an object store with a defined schema, primary key,
        and unique index. Implementing transaction-based CRUD operations reinforced my understanding of database integrity and lifecycle management.
        I also considered deployment constraints by selecting IndexedDB specifically because it works within a static GitHub Pages environment,
        demonstrating the ability to match technical solutions to environmental limitations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Security has become an increasingly important consideration in my development process. In the capstone artifact, I implemented input
        validation at multiple layers, enforced unique constraints at both the service and database levels, and introduced a least-privilege
        permission gate that defaults the application to read-only mode. Administrative write actions require unlocking with a hashed PIN stored
        in the browser. While this is not equivalent to full server-side authentication, it reflects a security mindset that anticipates misuse
        and enforces boundaries even in small-scale applications. This experience has reinforced the importance of designing with security in mind
        from the outset rather than treating it as an afterthought.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond this artifact, coursework in software testing, system architecture, and database management has contributed to a broader understanding
        of the software development lifecycle. I have learned to approach development iteratively, evaluate feedback constructively, and refine both
        functionality and presentation. The process of enhancing a single artifact across three major computer science domains helped me see how these
        domains intersect rather than exist independently.
      </p>

      <p>
        Collectively, the artifacts in this ePortfolio demonstrate growth in software design, algorithmic reasoning, database implementation,
        communication, and security awareness. The enhancements build upon one another: architectural improvements support algorithmic efficiency,
        database persistence strengthens reliability, and permission controls reinforce security principles. Together, they form a cohesive representation
        of my abilities as a developing computer science professional and illustrate my readiness to contribute meaningfully in a technical environment.
      </p>
